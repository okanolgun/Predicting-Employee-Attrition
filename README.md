# Predicting-Employee-Attrition

In this project, we looked at a dataset from a workplace. There was information about employees in different columns in this dataset. We tried to predict whether these employees would leave their jobs one day with a machine learning model. In this machine learning project, we used a random tree classification model. If you examine our dataset and look at the Jupyter output of the code, you can see the necessary analyzes and model scores.
